This is a repository for my mostly Arduino and STM32 tinkering projects.

**7 segment diplay**
A simple potentiatemeter controlled 7 segment display which is driven by a 7 segment decoder.

**Bit-Bagning**
This project involves bare metal MCU programming. Using bit manipulation a PWM signal is being generated pin non PWM enabled pins on Arduino.

**Bit Bangin  2**
This project lights up two LEDs for different time intervals: YELLOW 1 second on / 1 second off, and GREEN 1 minute on / 1 minute off.
The whole process is once again managed by bit and register manipulation
